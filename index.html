    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <div class="project">
        <p>Hello! I'm a 3rd year Bachelor of Design student at Melbourne University, majoring in Computing and Software Systems.  
        I have experience working with Java, C, SQL and Python, and have created a variety of programs and projects ranging from small utilities to more complex programs.  
        I enjoy analyzing problems, designing solutions, and learning new technologies along the way.  
        Through my projects, I have developed strong skills in programming logic, software development, and problem-solving, and I am always eager to take on new challenges.</p>

    <h2>Accident Severity Report</h2>
    <div class="project">
        <h3>Summary</h3>
        <p>
            This report investigates the impact of road types, road conditions, intersection types, and speed zones on accident severity. Relevant data was used from the following datasets provided by VicRoads: Accidents, Vehicle and Road Surface Condition. 
            The data was prepared by managing anomalies in speed zone data, handling missing values, removing duplicates, and one-hot encoding categorical variables. 
            The relationship between the pre-crash variables and crash severity was investigated using correlation analysis and two different supervised learning models. 
            The correlation analysis primarily consisted of using mutual information to explore non-linear associations between road features and severity levels. 
            The analysis revealed that most individual features had weak associations, however there were some notable patterns identified. 
            Visualizations such as stacked bar charts and distribution graphs displayed the trends. 
            Supervised learning models were developed to predict whether a vehicle’s damage would be severe given road surface, road surface condition, intersection type, and speed. 
            The models also revealed the extent to which each variable contributed to predicting accident severity. 
            Overall, the report demonstrates that speed zones have the most important impact on severity, while road surface condition and certain intersection types also have notable impact.
